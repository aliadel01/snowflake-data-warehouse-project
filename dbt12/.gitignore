# ------------------------------------
# 1. DBT GENERATED FILES (CRITICAL)
# ------------------------------------

# The 'target' folder contains all compiled SQL, run results,
# manifests, and catalogs. It should always be excluded.
target/

# The 'logs' folder contains the dbt.log file and should not be versioned.
logs/

# The 'dbt_packages' folder is generated by 'dbt deps'.
# It should not be committed. Users should run 'dbt deps' locally.
dbt_packages/

# The 'dbt_internal_packages' folder is managed by the dbt adapter.
dbt_internal_packages/

# Python compiled files (if you are running python models/macros)
*.pyc

# ------------------------------------
# 2. OPERATING SYSTEM & EDITOR FILES
# ------------------------------------

# VS Code specific settings (user preferences, not code)
.vscode/

# macOS system files
.DS_Store

# ------------------------------------
# 3. GLOBAL SENSITIVE/EXTERNAL FILES (Add these if they are inside dbt12)
# ------------------------------------

# If you have a profiles.yml in the dbt project folder (rare, but good to cover)
profiles.yml
